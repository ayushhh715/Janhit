# Janhit

## Overview
This is a MERN stack-based Civic Engagement Portal that allows local residents to report civic issues, vote on them, and track their resolution. It uses a map-based interface for real-time issue tracking, allowing users to easily raise and resolve local problems.

### Problem Statement:
In many communities, residents struggle to report civic issues like potholes, broken streetlights, or garbage dumps due to the lack of a centralized, transparent platform. Often, these problems go unnoticed by authorities or unresolved for long periods, causing frustration among citizens and inefficiencies in local governance. There is a need for a system that allows easy reporting, prioritization based on public input, and accountability in issue resolution.

### Features:
- **Map-based reporting**: Users can drop pins on the map to report problems.
- **Voting system**: Other users can can give severity rating on reported problems to prioritize them. If severity is greater than  or equal to 3 then vote is count of that problem
- **Issue management**: Municipality and government officials can view and resolve reported problems.
- **Comment and rating system**: Users can add comments, and track their status.
